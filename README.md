# singleton-pattern

The Singleton Pattern is like having a single copy of a valuable tool that everyone shares. Imagine you have a magic toolbox in your house, and no matter which room you go to, there's always only one toolbox that you can access. 
If someone else is already using the toolbox in another room, you have to wait until they're done. 
This ensures that everyone uses the same toolbox, so you don't end up with multiple toolboxes scattered around the house, which could lead to confusion and inconsistency.

In the world of programming, the Singleton Pattern ensures that there is only one instance of a particular class throughout the entire program. 
This is useful when you need to coordinate actions across the system, like logging information or managing settings. 
The Singleton Pattern controls the creation of that single instance and provides a global point of access to it.
